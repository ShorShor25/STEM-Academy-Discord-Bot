# STEM-Academy-Discord-Bot

In Secaucus High School, we have the STEM Academy, where a group of selected people in each grade go through a tough 4 years of high school where they have to take rigorous courses.

As a member of the STEM Academy, it is definitely not easy. It is best for all of us in the academy to help each other out and help those that are struggling. Compared to a typical messaging app, Discord has a feature of creating a server that has channels. In a server, there can be more people than a messaging group. Along with that, Discord bots are allowed in servers which makes it easier for the people depending on the type of server they are in.

For this project, I created a Discord Bot that creates sutdy sessions and notifies people in the server if they want to join them.
